The CPU of a system having 1 MIPS execution rate needs 4 machine cycles on an average for executing an instruction. The fifty percent of the cycles use memory bus. A memory read/ write employs one machine cycle. For execution of the programs the system utilizes 90 percent of the CPU time. For block data transfer an IO device is attached to the system while CPU executes the background programs continuously. What is the maximum IO data transfer rate if programmed IO data transfer technique is used?,250 Kbytes/sec,200 Kbytes/sec,125 Kbytes/sec,255 Kbytes/sec,1
