Consider a source computer(S) transmitting a file of size 106 bits to a destination computer(D)over a network of two routers (R1 and R2) and three links(L1 L2 and L3). L1connects S to R1; L2 connects R1 to R2; and L3 connects R2 to D.Let each link be of length 100 km. Assume signals travel over each link at a speed of 108 meters per second.Assume that the link bandwidth on each link is 1Mbps. Let the file be broken down into 1000 packets each of size 1000 bits. Find the total sum of transmission and propagation delays in transmitting the file from S to D?,1005
